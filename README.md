# üîß Electronics Lab Inventory Management System

A responsive, full-stack web application to manage components in electronics R\&D and manufacturing laboratories. Designed to streamline stock handling, minimize manual errors, and provide real-time inventory insights.

## üßπ Problem Statement

Electronics labs deal with a vast variety of components like resistors, ICs, sensors, and connectors. Manual tracking is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks real-time insights ‚Äî leading to stockouts, delays, or surplus.

This system enables:

* Efficient tracking of stock movements (inward/outward)
* Component search and categorization
* Low stock & old stock notifications
* Role-based user access
* Visual dashboards with meaningful insights

## üß™ Sample Workflow

1. **Admin** logs in, creates user roles, sets stock thresholds.
2. **Lab Technician** adds incoming stock for resistors, ICs, etc.
3. **Researcher** searches components (e.g., "4.7 Ohm Resistor") and views availability.
4. **Engineer** logs outward movement for a project.
5. System checks daily for critical/idle stock and alerts the admin.
6. **Admin** reviews dashboard stats for restocking decisions.
